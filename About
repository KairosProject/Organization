We are an international group of open source developers working to accelerate the adoption of blockchain technology by providing user friendly products.

In dexlab.io we believe that decentralised fintech services should be accessible to everyone and offer great user experience.

Currently our core product is a multi-coin mobile wallet with an integrated decentralised protocol-agnostic exchange. 

We built on an abstraction layer to both use 0x / Loopring / Kyber / Etherdelta protocols while overcoming common DEX UX flaws (i.e. no ETH wrapping, no LRC / ZRX, poor feedback, etc).

The app will allow newbies and more experienced users alike to make fast and easy one-click crypto exchanges. 

With dexlab.io wallet you can already buy and sell $DAI on the mainnet.

We're currently running user experience surveys and security tests and planning to expand to multiple tokens and protocols.
