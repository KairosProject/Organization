## Abstract

Governance Model, how we plan to achieve transparency and inclusion for the Community

## Specification

### Goals

We want a productive, happy and agile community that can welcome and bring forth new ideas.

We will rely on 5 key principles:

- Independence
  - Decision-making structure
  - Independence from employment relations
- Pluralism
  - Diversity of contributors
  - Management of conflict
  - Determination of leadership—processes and turnover
- Representation
  - Membership structure and rights
  - Ways in which those in authority are accountable to contributing members
  - Degree to which members can exercise voice on community members
- Decentralized decision-making
  - How contributors gain code commit and #frontline rights
  - How contributors gain access to the project’s decision-making structure
  - The degree to which project communications and activities are publicly available
- Autonomous participation
  - Newcomer joining rate
  - Newcomer socialization opportunities
  - Rate of idea generation

### Description

Our Code of Conduct and Community Guidelines act as a basis for all our community activity, how to participate, how to grow our community, how to represent to others outside the community.

Proposed meetings:

- **Dev meeting**: Bi-weekly, Fridays on uneven weeks. Time 14.00 CEST.
  - Discussion on current technical development, what has got done, what needs to get done for the next release etc.
  - Facilitator: Tech Lead
  - Participants: Dexlab Dev team + Any Dexlab team members who want to participate + possible relevant contributors
  - Viewers: Public on Youtube

- **High Council Meeting**: Monthly, Last Friday of the month. Time 15.00 CEST.
  - Discussion about the state of Dexlab, near future plans and decisions that need to be made. 10 min presentations with slides from team members, in which each one will run through the most important things we have done during the month, the problems they have found, and what they plan to do next month.
  - Facilitator: Project Lead

### Structures:
- Project Lead or Tech Lead will have final call on all things pertaining to their area of expertise.
- Decisions made after thorough conversation on Meetings, informal vote to be taken if necessary, possible conflicts discussed if necessary, final vote if needed and decision confirmed by Project/Tech Lead.
- Facilitators are responsible for gathering the agenda for the Meetings where applicable, as well as either taking notes of the Meeting and decisions made or delegating this responsibility to another participant
- Use (The Etherian’s or our own) [Colony](https://colony.io/) to have community members participate and get rewarded for their non-code contributions
- Implement a system similar to [Maker’s Actions](http://makerdao.com) and post a monthly transparency report about the use of funds to the blog
- GitHub Issues will be used as a forum to discuss proposals by community and team members
- We’ll have templates that can/will be used for the basis of agendas in Meetings so the Facilitator can easily fill out each Meetings info, like who will be presenting what, who has slides etc.
- Facilitator of the Meeting will make sure that the discussion stays on rails, everyone gets a chance to speak their mind, everything on the agenda is discussed, necessary decisions are made and that the Meeting length stays on a reasonable length
